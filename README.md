# Quality of life stuff
This repository contains some quality of life software that I wrote to improve my programming experience. This will probably not be updated regularly as I write these when I feel like it. Also please forgive me if there is missing documentation or anything related to use of the software, I didn't think I would make it public. I will add it eventually.
## Before use!
This is free software, do with it as you will, **BUT** I am not sure if anything I used has some specific licence, so I guess you will have to check it yourself & leave a reference to this repository, so anyone can know where the code came from.
I will check and update stuff if there is any licence preventing me from having it here, but that will take time.
Also I am not liable for anything you or the code does.
